# Assignment on Aliases

## Task 1
Install the package lolcat and create an alias to run `lolcat` instead of `cat`. View the file ~/.bash_history with cat  

## Task 2
Once tested make sure that your alias will be remembered in the future (after reboot, etc)

## Task 3
Create an aliases to clear you screen when you give the command `c`

## Task 4
Remove the alias `c` to clear your screen

## Task 5
Search the manpage of the command `free` to find out how you can show the results in __gigabytes__ and __human readable__. Add an alias to the system that will be remembered in the future (after reboot, etc) that when you issue the command `memory` the command `free` will be executed with the options you have found.    

The output must be something like this:  

```bash
student@linux-ess:~$ memory
               total        used        free      shared  buff/cache   available
Mem:            3.9G        315M        3.0G        1.0M        575M        3.3G
Swap:             0B          0B          0B
```

## Task 6
Use Task 8 of the control operators assignments and create an alias _show_ with it.
