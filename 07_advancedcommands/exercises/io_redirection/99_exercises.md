# Assignment on I/O redirection

## Task 1
Create a new file named "userinfo" in your homefolder. Do this by redirecting the output of the echo command of the variable $USER to this file  

## Task 2
Add the output of an echo of the variable $UID to this file  

## Task 3
Copy, without using sudo, the directory /etc to the directory /tmp recursively (= all subfolders and files included). It's normal to get a few error messages! Use the manpage of the copy command to search for a solution to copy recursively  

## Task 4
Do the last exercise again, but send the error messages to the black hole

## Task 5
Do the same exercise again, but send the error messages to ~/backup.errors

## Task 6
Execute ls /tmp/* while sending the result and error messages to the file ~/contentslashtmp.full

## Task 7
Empty out the file userinfo by adding only one character in front of the filename on the command line
