# Assignment on logging

## Task 1
View the system log using journalctl

## Task 2
Use less to find the first occurance of the term 'filesystem' in your journal

## Task 3
Find all log events related to networking (systemd-networkd.service is the service that handles all network-related tasks on your system.)

## Task 4
Find all log events with a priority of 'critical' or higher.
  
## Task 5
Filter the logfile so that it shows the events for the first time your system booted (or the oldest available). Write these events to a file called first_boot in your homefolder.

## Task 6
See all events for the week starting on November 28.

## Task 7
Show the last 20 events generated by the cron-service.

## Task 8
See all events that happened last week, with a priority of warning or higher.
 
## Task 9
Use journalctl to show all the events generated by the auth rsyslog-facility. You'll find the option for this in the man-page.
