# Introduction

## Linux
Windows, made by Microsoft, is a well-known Operating System mostly used on Desktop computers, but there are other alternatives as well. One of the more popular ones are MacOSX, ChromeOS and, of course, Linux. Linux, using a desktop environment, is less prominent than the others.

In Server / IOT / mobile environments, a certain shift in used Operating Systems occurred. Linux is one of the most popular operating systems in these markets. Some interesting statements:

Linux is used in smartphones, (web) servers, tablets, IoT devices, Smart washing machines, self driving cars, modems, routers, PlayStations, ... In brief: Linux is used way more than you would initially think. Linux even has its own mascotte, the penguin named Tux!

### Unix
Dennis Ritchie and Ken Thompson created the Unix operating system in 1969. The source code from this OS was shared at that time. After a while the company AT&T Bell Labs decided they wanted to sell Unix commercially. BSD further developed the Operating System independently from Unix. This led to subsequent versions:
* Unix: The commercial version
* BSD Unix: The open source version

In the '80 there were different versions of Unix. Because Unix was commercialized (AT&T), the source code of Unix was rewritten: GNU project ("GNU is not unix"). The goal of GNU was the development of an open source Operating System where everyone could work on together as a community. The GNU project was missing a kernel.

### Linux
A student, named Linus Torvalds, created a post in a newsgroup about his own Operating System in the '90:

We are still using the Linux kernel today. The kernel is being further developed every day.

#### Linux distributions
Linux distributions (distros in short) simplify the process of installing gnu/linux and other apps on your computer. Well-known distros are Ubuntu, RedHat, Fedora, CentOS, Debian, Archlinux and Oracle Linux. Because linux is very scalable, there are also special distros for a certain purpose, for example clonezilla.
