# Lab <!-- {docsify-ignore} -->
### Intro

In this course we follow Linus. Linus is a first year computer science student at the PXL university college. His hobbies are making music, going out and gaming.

He recently purchased Minecraft, a very popular sandbox game. He has spent hours in his own offline world and considers himself a Minecraft master. His friends also want to play the game and they often share stories about their adventures and builds. 

All of them have been watching Twitch where they noticed that streamers often play together in a shared world. Intrigued by the idea of a shared world, Linus finds himself searching for options to host one of those worlds himself. He reads online that he will need a *minecraft server*. This is a computer (server) that hosts the world and to which all the players can connect to using the internet.

This is *exactly* what Linus is looking for. After doing some research he finds out that setting up such a server is not an easy task. He reads about all kinds of concepts such as Linux, Unix, chmod, apt, ... that he never heard of before. As determined as Linus is, he will not rest before setting up a minecraft server called *LinusCraft* so he can play with his friends.

This is where our story begins. In this course we will follow Linus in a set of labs where we will use and learn new concepts with the goal of setting up and maintaining a minecraft server.  Before setting up this minecraft-server, he wants to advertise it via an own  webserver and website.

For the labs in this course we will use [Minetest](https://www.minetest.net/). This is an _open source_ project that looks alot like the real minecraft. The benefit of using Minetest is that it is free to play and support different operating systems out of the box.



We start with the Labs from next chapter.
